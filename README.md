# RegisterUserLogIn


This is a user registration/login project made with Java, Spring boot framework, Javascript jQuery and H2 database.
The client creates an account on the "opprett.html" file, and then logs in from the "login.html" file.
The client will then be successfully logged in and get access to the index.html file. 
The username and hashed password will be saved into the H2 database.
